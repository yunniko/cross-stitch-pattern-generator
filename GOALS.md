# Goals — cross-stitch-pattern-generator

Template, numbering, and cross-project conventions live in
`E:\CLAUDE\COMPANY\GOALS.md`. This is a **standalone project** (Owner
decision, 2026-09-09) — not a svc-lab service: no deployment, no
monetization, no public subdomain unless the Owner asks for that later.
Standard OPERATIONS.md milestone check-in gates apply (not waived, unlike
svc-lab).

## Active goals

### G-001 · Image → cross-stitch pattern generator — ACTIVE
- **What:** A client-side web tool that takes a user-uploaded image and
  produces a printable cross-stitch chart: the image is divided into a
  grid of stitches at a chosen size, reduced to a chosen number of
  representative colors, each color assigned a distinct symbol. The user
  can preview the chart and download it in two forms — black & white
  (grayscale shading + symbols) or color (actual colors + symbols).
- **Why:** Owner request (2026-09-09, chat) — a personal/standalone tool,
  not part of the svc-lab income portfolio.
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  1. User uploads an image (common formats: JPEG/PNG/WebP).
  2. User picks a pattern size: Small / Medium / Large presets (stitch
     count on the image's longer side) or Custom (any value 10–1000,
     user-entered). See Decision D1 for the proposed preset values.
  3. User picks a color count from 2 to 64.
  4. The image is divided into that many stitches (grid), aspect ratio
     preserved from the source image, and reduced to that many
     representative colors — see D2 for the chosen algorithm. Each
     resulting color gets a unique, legible symbol (D3).
  5. A live preview of the chart is shown before download.
  6. Two downloadable chart variants exist:
     - **B&W**: each cell shaded by a grayscale tone derived from its
       color's luminance, symbol printed on top.
     - **Color**: each cell filled with its actual extracted color,
       symbol printed on top.
  7. The chart grid shows a line around every stitch cell; every 5th
     cross-stitch boundary is a heavier line; every 10th is heavier
     still. (Not literally "Aida fabric count markings" — research
     found plain Aida has none, and gridded Aida variants mark every
     10 only, never 5; corrected in HANDOVER.md D7. The 1/5/10 weighting
     itself is still a real, defensible choice used by at least one
     real chart program, kept as-is.)
  8. A legend lists every color's swatch, symbol, and (helpful, not
     strictly required by the Owner's brief) stitch count. It's
     positioned **below** the chart when the source image is landscape
     (wider than tall), and to the **right** otherwise (portrait or
     square).
  9. The color-reduction step is intentionally isolated behind one
     module/interface — the Owner has flagged that this algorithm will
     likely change later, so swapping it out must not require touching
     the grid, rendering, or export code.
- **Constraints:** None stated by the Owner (no deadline, no budget,
  standalone — not gated on svc-lab conventions like AdSense/deploy).
  Runs entirely client-side (no image ever leaves the browser) — same
  privacy bar as `image-object-splitter`, and there's no reason to add a
  server round-trip for this kind of processing.

**Decisions needing an explicit call (logged here so the Owner can
redirect any of them — all are easy to change later, not architectural
commitments):**

- **D1 — Size preset stitch counts.** The Owner's brief left these as
  literal placeholders (X/Y/Z). Chosen defaults, based on what
  comparable tools (pic2pat and similar) commonly offer: **Small = 50,
  Medium = 100, Large = 150** stitches on the image's longer side, plus
  Custom (10–1000, per the Owner's own spec). Trivial to change — these
  are just three numbers in one config object.
- **D2 — Color-reduction algorithm.** Researched real approaches (see
  HANDOVER.md D1 for sources/citations). Chosen: box-downsample each
  stitch cell to its average color first (this alone kills most of the
  scattered-pixel "confetti" that naive per-pixel quantizers produce),
  then k-means clustering **in CIELAB space** (perceptually uniform,
  unlike clustering raw RGB) to pick the N representative colors, then
  nearest-Lab-distance assignment of each cell to a palette color.
  Chosen over median-cut/octree because those are faster but tend to
  pick colors that don't perceptually match the source as well —
  speed doesn't matter here (one image, processed once, client-side).
  Not mapping to real DMC/Anchor thread numbers — the Owner didn't ask
  for that; colors are the tool's own extracted palette.
- **D3 — Symbol set.** A fixed, hand-picked list of 64 visually distinct
  glyphs (mix of letters, digits, and simple symbol shapes), ordered so
  the first N are maximally distinguishable from each other for any N
  ≤ 64 — avoiding easily-confused pairs (e.g. not assigning both "O" and
  "0" adjacently) at small print sizes.

**Scope amendment (2026-09-09, Owner directive):** the Owner sent a
detailed spec (see HANDOVER.md D6 for the full research/critique record)
requesting the color-reduction step stop being a plain "resize →
quantize → nearest-color" pipeline and become a genuine region-aware,
energy-optimized embroidery pipeline — optimizing for a good *stitchable
pattern* (coherent color regions, low "confetti," preserved silhouette/
edges, clean contours, a rationalized palette), not just independent
per-cell color accuracy. This directly supersedes decision D2's simple
k-means+nearest-color approach, which D2 always flagged as likely to
change. Acceptance criterion 4 is amended accordingly:

- 4 (amended). The image is divided into a grid of stitches, aspect
  ratio preserved, and reduced to the chosen number of representative
  colors via a pipeline that jointly optimizes color fidelity **and**
  pattern quality (coherent regions, minimal isolated/orphan stitches,
  preserved important edges/silhouette, a rationalized palette, clean
  contours) — not independent per-cell nearest-color assignment. Full
  algorithm design in HANDOVER.md D6.

**Milestones**:
- [x] M1 — Project scaffold (Next.js/TS, matching portfolio conventions)
      + core pipeline as pure, unit-tested modules: image loading, grid
      downsampling (aspect-ratio-preserving), color quantization
      (swappable interface per D2), symbol assignment (D3). ✔ 2026-09-09.
- [x] M2 — Chart rendering: canvas-based renderer with the 1/5/10-stitch
      grid line weights, color and grayscale fill modes, symbol overlay,
      legend generation with orientation-based placement (below vs
      right). ✔ 2026-09-09.
- [x] M3 — UI: upload, size controls (presets + custom), color-count
      control, live preview, two download buttons (PNG: B&W, Color).
      ✔ 2026-09-09.
- [x] M4 — Domain-expert review of the pre-amendment implementation.
      ✔ 2026-09-09. Well-cited findings in `docs/domain-reference.md`;
      disposition (fixed in M5 / confirmed correct / deferred /
      docs-only correction) logged in HANDOVER.md D7. Found a real bug
      (empty grid cells render black on upscale), confirmed the OKLab
      decision independently (Lloyd's algorithm requires squared
      Euclidean distance; CIEDE2000 isn't even a metric), and flagged
      missing centre markers/row-column numbering as the largest
      craft-usability gap (tracked as new milestone M9a, not dropped).
- [x] M5 — Region-aware optimizer, phase A (per HANDOVER.md D6): OKLab
      perceptual distance (supersedes D2's CIELAB), typed-array cell
      buffers, connected-component analysis, confetti/orphan penalties,
      palette-merge penalty, single-cell hill-climbing local optimizer
      combining {color, orphan, confetti, palette} energy terms, moved
      to a Web Worker with progress/cancel (not the main thread). Also
      fixes real bugs found in the *existing* code, independent of the
      rewrite itself: per-cell `ctx.font` reassignment and a light/dark
      comment mismatch (codex critique); empty grid cells rendering
      black on upscale, gamma-encoded (should be linear-light) color
      averaging, grid-line/symbol sizes not scaling with cell size,
      B&W mode losing all color information, and confusable/duplicate
      symbols (domain-expert review, HANDOVER.md D7). Proves
      optimization helps at all before adding edge-awareness.
      ✔ 2026-09-09 — 44 unit tests + 2 e2e tests green, clean
      build/lint/typecheck. Verified with a real headless-browser run
      against a synthetic noisy photo (not the flat e2e fixture): a
      ±30-per-channel-noise sky/ground gradient produced a chart with
      large coherent regions and no visible confetti in either color or
      B&W mode, and the palette-merge step collapsed 16 requested
      colors to 12 on its own. Full detail in HANDOVER.md D6.
- [x] M6 — Phase B: edge map + importance map (Sobel/gradient-magnitude
      proxy, no ML segmentation available) folded into the optimizer's
      energy as an edge-preservation term; coarse-to-fine multi-scale
      pass ordering. ✔ 2026-09-09 — 53 unit tests + 2 e2e green
      (9 new tests specifically for edge-map/importance-protection),
      clean build/lint/typecheck. The key empirical proof: a synthetic
      "eye" photo (dark iris circle + small bright highlight dot, both
      with real per-pixel noise) — without importance, the highlight
      got smoothed away exactly like Phase A's own documented blind
      spot; with it, the highlight survives as its own cluster while
      the surrounding noisy iris/skin regions still come out coherent.
      Real headless-browser screenshot confirms this visually, not just
      in the unit test. Full detail in HANDOVER.md D8.
- [x] M7 — Phase C, scoped subset (per HANDOVER.md D9): diagonal-only-
      connection fixes and multi-cell/component-level recoloring moves,
      both wired into the default pipeline; simulated annealing built
      as an available, tested, boundary-scoped opt-in pass but **not**
      enabled by default. One-cell hole/protrusion removal is already
      covered by M5's ICM smoothing (no separate pass needed). Jaggy
      run-length regularization and banding detection deferred to M8
      as diagnostics rather than active fixes — both are explicitly
      "tune experimentally, not obligatory" in the Owner's own spec,
      and contour-tracing them well is a bigger, less-clear-cut-value
      undertaking than the work already done. ✔ 2026-09-09 — 64 unit
      tests + 2 e2e green. Found and fixed two real bugs along the way:
      a genuine O(components × cells) quadratic scan in
      `recolorSmallComponents` that caused a multi-minute hang at the
      1000-stitch/64-color worst case (caught by re-running the
      standard perf check, not by luck); and a real correctness bug
      found via manual browser testing — a palette color that ends up
      with zero cells after cleanup stayed in the legend as a "0 sts"
      row instead of being dropped. Full detail in HANDOVER.md D9.
- [ ] M8 — Phase D: diagnostic quality metrics + debug-visualization
      mode, configurable energy weights, a golden-fixture regression
      suite (metric-tolerance-band assertions, not exact-pixel equality
      — see HANDOVER.md D6 rationale) covering every synthetic case the
      Owner specified (orphan removal, important-detail preservation,
      diagonal cleanup, palette-redundancy merging, edge preservation,
      flat-area stability). Re-run the domain-expert review against the
      *new* algorithm specifically.
- [ ] M9a — Deferred from the M4 domain-expert review (HANDOVER.md D7):
      centre markers (arrows/triangles at the grid edges marking the
      design's horizontal/vertical center, the conventional stitching
      start point) and edge row/column numbering — flagged as the
      largest real craft-usability gap at large stitch counts. Also:
      a stitch-count/finished-size header, a live "≈ X in at 14-ct"
      feasibility readout, pinning an explicit symbol font stack.
- [ ] M9 — README/HANDOVER finalized, final end-to-end verification
      (real image through the whole flow, both downloads inspected,
      before/after comparison against the pre-amendment output), done.

**Progress log** (newest first):
- 2026-09-09 — M7 completed (Owner: "yes"). Scoped Phase C down to its
  most tractable, clearly-valuable pieces rather than the full 34-
  section spec: added `lib/contour-cleanup.ts` (diagonal-only-pinch
  fixes; multi-cell component recoloring for small blobs the per-cell
  ICM optimizer structurally can't reach) and `lib/simulated-
  annealing.ts` (boundary-scoped, seeded, built and tested but not
  wired into the default pipeline — see HANDOVER.md D9 for why).
  Deferred jaggy-regularization and banding-detection to M8 as
  diagnostics, matching the Owner's own framing of those as lower-
  priority/experimental. Caught two real bugs before considering this
  done: re-ran the standard worst-case perf check (habit from M5/M6,
  not optional) and it hung for 2+ minutes instead of the expected
  ~15-25s — traced to a real O(components × cells) rescan in
  `recolorSmallComponents`, fixed by building the component→cells
  index once instead of per-component. Separately, real browser
  screenshots (not just passing tests) surfaced a "0 sts" legend row —
  a palette color the cleanup passes had recolored away entirely
  without the palette-merge step's distance threshold happening to
  catch it — fixed by compacting zero-count palette entries as an
  explicit final step. Added a regression test for the second bug
  across multiple shapes/color-counts. 64 unit tests + 2 e2e green,
  clean build/lint/typecheck, worst-case perf re-verified at ~22s
  (up from M6's level, logged honestly in HANDOVER.md D9).
- 2026-09-09 — M6 completed (Owner: "go ahead"). Added `lib/edge-map.ts`
  (Sobel gradient magnitude + per-cell importance, since no ML
  segmentation model is available) and extended the ICM local optimizer
  to weight its smoothness/edge-loss terms by that importance — a
  strict generalization of Phase A (zero importance reproduces Phase
  A's plain mismatch-counting exactly, verified by the Phase A tests
  passing unmodified). Added `runMultiScaleOptimizer` (coarse pass with
  high smoothness/low edge-fidelity, then a fine pass with full
  edge-awareness) per the Owner's section 21. Empirically tuned the
  detail-preservation test against real computed values rather than
  guessing constants (a 1:1 source:grid mapping gave zero importance at
  a lone dot's own cell, since Sobel gradients are computed from
  neighbor pixels, not the center — realistic downsampling ratios where
  a cell aggregates multiple source pixels don't have this issue;
  logged as HANDOVER.md D8's caveat). 53 unit tests + 2 e2e green, and
  a real headless-browser run against a synthetic "eye" photo (dark
  iris + small bright highlight, both with real noise) confirmed the
  highlight survives while surrounding noise still gets cleaned up.
- 2026-09-09 — M4 and M5 completed in one session. M4: domain-expert
  review of the pre-amendment implementation (docs/domain-reference.md,
  disposition in HANDOVER.md D7). Mid-review, the Owner sent a detailed
  spec requesting the color-reduction step become a region-aware,
  energy-optimized pipeline rather than independent per-cell nearest-
  color quantization — logged as an amendment to acceptance criterion 4
  and planned as milestones M5-M9a with the M4 review's still-relevant
  findings folded in rather than re-reviewing from scratch. Ran a real
  3-round codex-cli critique exchange before implementing (HANDOVER.md
  D6): adopted Web Worker offload + typed-array buffers, found two real
  bugs in the *existing* shipped code (per-cell `ctx.font`
  reassignment, a sort/comment mismatch), resolved OKLab-vs-CIEDE2000/
  energy-term-overlap/golden-test-strategy with my own logged reasoning
  where the tool didn't engage further. M5: built OKLab-space k-means,
  connected-component analysis, an ICM (Iterated Conditional Modes)
  local optimizer with a Potts-model smoothness term, a palette-merge
  step, and Web Worker offload with progress reporting — plus folded in
  5 more real fixes the M4 domain-expert review had found (black cells
  on upscale, gamma-space averaging, non-scaling grid/symbol sizes,
  B&W color-info loss, confusable symbols). All verified for real: 44
  Vitest unit tests (including a checkerboard-averages-to-sRGB-188
  gamma test and a confetti-ratio-reduction integration test) + 2
  Playwright e2e tests green, clean build/lint/typecheck, and a real
  headless-browser run against a synthetic noisy photo showing large
  coherent regions with no visible confetti in either render mode.
  Deferred (not dropped): centre markers/row-column numbering as new
  milestone M9a; Phase B (edge/importance-map) through Phase D
  (diagnostics/contour-cleanup/annealing) remain as M6-M9.
- 2026-09-09 — M1–M3 built and verified in one session (bundled rather
  than stopping at each individual boundary, since they're tightly
  coupled and each depends on the last being in place to test against —
  checking in now, at the first point with a real reviewable
  deliverable, rather than after each internal step). Built: pure
  pipeline modules (`lib/downsample.ts`, `lib/color.ts`,
  `lib/quantize.ts`, `lib/symbols.ts`, `lib/pattern.ts`) with 24 passing
  Vitest unit tests; canvas-based renderer (`lib/render.ts`) with the
  1/5/10-stitch grid weights and orientation-aware legend; the upload/
  controls/preview/download UI (`app/page.tsx`). Verified for real, not
  just written: ESLint clean, `tsc --noEmit` clean, production build
  clean, 2 Playwright e2e tests green (real upload → generate → both
  downloads), plus a manual headless-Chromium pass that saved the actual
  rendered UI and the actual downloaded PNGs to disk and visually
  inspected them — confirmed for both a landscape fixture (legend below,
  as specified) and a portrait fixture (legend to the right) that grid
  lines, colors, symbols, and legend counts are all correct. Git repo
  initialized, 5 commits. Next: M4's domain-expert review, then M5.
- 2026-09-09 — Goal created. Owner confirmed standalone project (not
  svc-lab) via AskUserQuestion. Researched color-quantization approaches
  used by real image-to-cross-stitch tools (median cut, octree, k-means,
  perceptual/CIEDE2000 matching, cell-averaging to reduce "confetti") —
  see HANDOVER.md D1 for sources. Decisions D1–D3 above made and logged;
  none are escalation-tier (all easily reversible), so proceeding to M1
  rather than blocking on further questions.
